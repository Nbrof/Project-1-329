      <h2>"About me"</h2>
      <p> "My name is Nikolaus Brodfuehrer, born and raised in Buffalo, New York. Since I was little I've always had an intrest in technology, regardless of it being the game systems that we're played or the 
         computers that we used. Over the years I found that curiosity gradually turned into a passion as I found more of time spent either repairing computer components or wonder how programs worked.
        This passion lead me where to I am today. Learning to code has given me a deeper insight to how the world of data and processing works. Taking this knowledge has lead me to career paths and 
      oppertunities to help others in ways I hadn't thought possible. This website, and soon to be others was built by me. If you are searching for someone who could help you with web development or code related projects please reach out to me!
